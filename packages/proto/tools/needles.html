    <h2>Needles</h2>
    <p>Choosing the right needle-although not imperative for a project-can be the difference between worlds when it comes to ease of machine sewing.
        When working with a difficult fabric of heavier weight, a heavy duty machine with more mechanical power is needed, and a thicker, sharper needle
        is needed to pierce the fabric as well. For lighter fabrics, sharp and thin needles are required to make decisive stitches in the weave.
